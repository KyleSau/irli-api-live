<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:

American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a national, nonprofit public interest,

<p class=""MsoListParagraph"" style=""margin: 0in 37.5pt 0.0001pt 0.5in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.25in; line-height: normal; background-position: initial; background-color: white;"">1.

.25in;line-height:normal"">For fee purposes, FAIR requests that
search, review, and production fees for this request be waived for two reasons.
First, FAIR is
entitled to a complete waiver of fees because of its public-interest purpose.
FOIA’s fee waiver provision is contained at 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). It
states as follows:<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:normal"">Documents shall be furnished
without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under
clause (ii) if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because
it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the
commercial interest of the requester.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">The Department of
Homeland Security (DHS) has promulgated a regulation implementing 5 U.S.C. §

</div>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">This regulation lists
four factors that should be used in determining whether the request is in the
public interest:<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2"">1.     
The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the
requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government.”
The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or
activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and
clear, not remote or attenuated. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2"">2.     
The informative value of the information to be disclosed:
Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of
government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested
records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or
activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public
understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information
that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a
substantially identical form, would not be as likely to contribute to such
understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2"">3.     
The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the
public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested
information will contribute to “public understanding.” The disclosure must
contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the
requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and
intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered.
It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this
consideration.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2"">4.     
The significance of the contribution to public understanding:
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public
understanding of government operations or activities. The public's
understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public
understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be enhanced by the
disclosure to a significant extent. Components shall not make value judgments
about whether information that would contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the government is “important”
enough to be made public.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">The law does not require a FOIA requester who qualifies
for a fee waiver to spell out to the government in exacting detail how the
disclosed information will significantly contribute to the public’s
understanding of the government’s operations. Instead, a requester need merely
“pinpoint the type of government activity he
is investigating” and describe with reasonable specificity the link between the
request and the enhancement of public awareness and understanding of
governmental activities.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHS-USCIS/FOIAs/USCIS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation%20materials)%20(11.15.2017).docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title=""""><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>
Also, agencies should administer the fee waiver
provision in “an objective manner and should not rely on their own, subjective
view as to the value of the information.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHS-USCIS/FOIAs/USCIS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation%20materials)%20(11.15.2017).docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title=""""><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">FAIR
easily satisfies each of the factors in DHS’s regulation. Firstly, the
information responsive to our request will significantly contribute to public
understanding of the operations and activities of the government, particularly
with regards to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program’s effectiveness at helping
refugees fit in before or after arriving in the country. Refugee admissions
having resumed late last month, the program’s effectiveness is under increased
public scrutiny.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHS-USCIS/FOIAs/USCIS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation%20materials)%20(11.15.2017).docx#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[3]</span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Secondly, the disclosure
will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
interested in the subject, as opposed to FAIR’s individual understanding, as FAIR intends to use its
analytical and editorial skills to publish and disseminate to the general
public the records obtained pursuant to this FOIA request through news
articles, press releases, action alerts, studies, and reports. Notably, FAIR possesses
a special expertise in the subject matter of this FOIA request as the largest
immigration reform organization in the United States that for more than thirty-five
years has published and disseminated information to the public about
immigration-related current events through the various media forms discussed
below. <o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Lastly,
the disclosure is likely to contribute
“significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities
for the aforementioned reasons.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">In
addition, FAIR
is a nonprofit organization as defined under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code and does not seek this information for any commercial benefit.
FAIR’s committed to protecting the public’s right to be aware of the
immigration-related activities of government agencies and to ensuring the
lawful and appropriate use of government funds by those agencies. As the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has noted, “Congress amended FOIA to
ensure that it is ‘liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial
requesters.’”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHS-USCIS/FOIAs/USCIS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation%20materials)%20(11.15.2017).docx#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[4]</span></span></a> Of the information requested, there is
no possibility, let alone plans, of pursuing profitmaking opportunities. The information will be used to
further the knowledge and interests of the general public. FAIR intends on disseminating its
analysis of the requested information through its regular channels, discussed
below. FAIR thus
satisfies this element.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal""><span lang=""EN-GB"">FAIR </span>is entitled to a complete waiver of fees<span lang=""EN-GB""> because FAIR
qualifies as a “representative of the news media, or news media requester”
under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). This provision </span><span lang=""EN-GB"">defines “representative[s] of the news media”

Moreover, the FOIA statute itself, as amended in 2007, explicitly defines
“representative of the news media”–a term previously undefined in the
statute–to specifically include organizations, such as FAIR, that regularly
publish and disseminate online periodicals, <i>e.g.</i>,
newsletters.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHS-USCIS/FOIAs/USCIS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation%20materials)%20(11.15.2017).docx#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[6]</span></sup></sup></a>

person or organization which regularly publishes or disseminates information to

easily qualifies for “representative of the news media, or news media
requester” status. Other agencies of the federal government have
granted FAIR “representative of the news media” category status.  <i>See,
e.g.</i>, FOIA Request No. 12-00455-F (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement),
news media status granted on Oct. 19, 2015; FOIA Request 15-FI-HQ-01975 (Department
of Housing and Urban Development), news media status granted on Oct. 30, 2015; FOIA
Request COW2016000114 (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services), on Feb. 10,
2016; FOIA Request 16-00374-F (Drug Enforcement Administration), news media
status granted on Mar. 4, 2016. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia noted in <i>Oglesby v. United States Dep’t of Army</i>, agencies
should grant news media requestor status when other agencies have done so
because of “the need for uniformity among the agencies in their application of
FOIA.” 920 F.2d 57, 66 (D.C. Cir. 1990). FAIR is the largest immigration reform organization in the

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">I write on behalf of my client the Federation for
American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a national, nonprofit public interest,
membership organization of concerned Americans who share a common belief that
our nation’s immigration policies must be reformed to serve the national
interest.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5
U.S.C. § 552, FAIR hereby requests that you produce the following records:<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoListParagraph"" style=""text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;
mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3"">1.     
Any
and all teaching materials, including but not limited to PowerPoint
presentations, pamphlets, lesson plans, videos and/or textbooks, used in or by
instructors for cultural orientation classes conducted in or by any and all
Resettlement Support Centers since Jan. 1, 2014.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"">For fee purposes, FAIR requests that search, review, and production
fees for this request be waived for two reasons. First, FAIR is entitled to a
complete waiver of fees because of its public-interest purpose. FOIA’s fee
waiver provision is contained at 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). It states as
follows:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"">Documents shall be furnished
without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under
clause (ii) if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because
it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the
commercial interest of the requestor.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">The Department of State
(DOS) has promulgated a regulation implementing 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) at
22 C.F.R. § 171.17. This regulation lists four factors that should be used in
determining whether the request is in the public interest:<o:p></o:p></p>





</div>

<br clear=""all"" style=""page-break-before:always;
mso-break-type:section-break"">




<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2"">1.     
The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the
requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government.”
The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or
activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and
clear, not remote or attenuated. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2"">2.     
The informative value of the information to be disclosed:
Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of
government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested
records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or
activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public understanding
of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already
is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical
form, would not be as likely to contribute to such understanding where nothing
new would be added to the public's understanding. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2"">3.     
The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the
public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested
information will contribute to “public understanding.” The disclosure must contribute
to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in
the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A
requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to
effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be
presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this
consideration.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2"">4.     
The significance of the contribution to public understanding:
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public
understanding of government operations or activities. The public's
understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public
understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be enhanced by the
disclosure to a significant extent. Components shall not make value judgments
about whether information that would contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the government is “important”
enough to be made public.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">The law does not require a FOIA requester who qualifies
for a fee waiver to spell out to the government in exacting detail how the
disclosed information will significantly contribute to the public’s
understanding of the government’s operations. Instead, a requester need merely
“pinpoint the type of government activity he
is investigating” and describe with reasonable specificity the link between the
request and the enhancement of public awareness and understanding of
governmental activities.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation)%20(11.15.17).docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title=""""><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>
Also, agencies should administer the fee waiver
provision in “an objective manner and should not rely on their
own, subjective view as to the value of the information.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation)%20(11.15.17).docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title=""""><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">FAIR easily satisfies each of the factors in State’s
regulation. Firstly, the information responsive to our request will
significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations and activities
of the government, particularly with regards to the U.S. Refugee Admissions
Program’s effectiveness at helping refugees fit in before or after arriving in
the country. Refugee admissions having resumed late last month, the program’s
effectiveness is under increased public scrutiny.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation)%20(11.15.17).docx#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[3]</span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Secondly, the disclosure
will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
interested in the subject, as opposed to FAIR’s individual understanding, as FAIR intends to use its
analytical and editorial skills to publish and disseminate to the general
public the records obtained pursuant to this FOIA request through news
articles, press releases, action alerts, studies, and reports. Notably, FAIR possesses
a special expertise in the subject matter of this FOIA request as the largest
immigration reform organization in the United States that for more than thirty-five
years has published and disseminated information to the public about
immigration-related current events through the various media forms discussed
below.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Lastly,
the disclosure is likely to contribute
“significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities
for the aforementioned reasons.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">In
addition, FAIR
is a nonprofit organization as defined under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code and does not seek this information for any commercial benefit.
FAIR’s committed to protecting the public’s right to be aware of the
immigration-related activities of government agencies and to ensuring the
lawful and appropriate use of government funds by those agencies. As the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has noted, “Congress amended FOIA to
ensure that it is ‘liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial
requesters.’”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation)%20(11.15.17).docx#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[4]</span></span></a> Of the information requested, there is
no possibility, let alone plans, of pursuing profitmaking opportunities. The information will be used to
further the knowledge and interests of the general public. FAIR intends on disseminating its
analysis of the requested information through its regular channels, discussed
below. FAIR thus
satisfies this element.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal""><span lang=""EN-GB"">Second, FAIR </span>is entitled to a complete waiver of fees<span lang=""EN-GB""> because FAIR
qualifies as a “representative of the news media, or news media requester”
under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). This provision </span><span lang=""EN-GB"">defines “representative[s] of the news media”
broadly to include organizations like FAIR that disseminate news through
electronic communications, including “<i>publishers
of periodicals </i>… who make their products available for purchase by or
subscription by or free distribution to the general public.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation)%20(11.15.17).docx#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[5]</span></sup></sup></a>
Moreover, the FOIA statute itself, as amended in 2007, explicitly defines
“representative of the news media”–a term previously undefined in the
statute–to specifically include organizations, such as FAIR, that regularly
publish and disseminate online periodicals, <i>e.g.</i>,
newsletters.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation)%20(11.15.17).docx#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[6]</span></sup></sup></a>
The statutory definition unequivocally requires that organizations which
electronically disseminate information and publications via “alternative media <i>shall</i> be considered to be news-media
entities.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation)%20(11.15.17).docx#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[7]</span></sup></sup></a>
What is more, in <i>National Security
Archive v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense</i>,<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation)%20(11.15.17).docx#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[8]</span></sup></sup></a> the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit noted FOIA’s legislative
history demonstrates that “it is critical that the phrase ‘representative of
the news media’ be broadly interpreted if the act is to work as expected… In
fact, any person or organization which regularly publishes or disseminates
information to the public… should qualify for waivers as a ‘representative of
the news media.’”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(RSC%20cultural%20orientation)%20(11.15.17).docx#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[9]</span></sup></sup></a><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:

easily qualifies for “representative of the news media, or news
media requester” status. Recently,
FAIR qualified for such status following the fee waiver determinations of two
agencies: the Department for Housing and Urban Development and U.S. Immigration
and Customs Enforcement (enclosed). FAIR is the largest immigration reform organization in the
United States and for more than thirty-five years has published and
disseminated information to the public about immigration-related current events

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"">For fee purposes, FAIR requests that search, review, and production
fees for this request be waived for two reasons. First, FAIR is entitled to a
complete waiver of fees because of its public-interest purpose. FOIA’s fee
waiver provision is contained at 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). It states as
follows:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"">Documents shall be furnished
without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under
clause (ii) if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because
it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the
commercial interest of the requestor.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">The Department of State
(DOS) has promulgated a regulation implementing 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) at
22 C.F.R. § 171.17. This regulation lists four factors that should be used in
determining whether the request is in the public interest:<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2"">1.     
The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the
requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government.”
The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or
activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and
clear, not remote or attenuated. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;

The informative value of the information to be disclosed:
Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of
government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested
records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or
activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public
understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information
that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a
substantially identical form, would not be as likely to contribute to such
understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding. <o:p></o:p></p>

The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the
public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested
information will contribute to “public understanding.” The disclosure must
contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the
requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and
intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered.
It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this
consideration.<o:p></o:p></p>

text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2"">4.     
The significance of the contribution to public understanding:
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public
understanding of government operations or activities. The public's
understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public
understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be enhanced by the
disclosure to a significant extent. Components shall not make value judgments
about whether information that would contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the government is “important”
enough to be made public.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">The law does not require a FOIA requester who qualifies
for a fee waiver to spell out to the government in exacting detail how the
disclosed information will significantly contribute to the public’s
understanding of the government’s operations. Instead, a requester need merely
“pinpoint the type of government activity he
is investigating” and describe with reasonable specificity the link between the
request and the enhancement of public awareness and understanding of
governmental activities.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Storella,%20Henshaw)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title=""""><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>
Also, agencies should administer the fee waiver
provision in “an objective manner and should not rely on their
own, subjective view as to the value of the information.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Storella,%20Henshaw)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title=""""><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">FAIR easily satisfies each of the factors in State’s
regulation. Firstly, the information responsive to our request will
significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations and activities
of the government, particularly with regards to the U.S. Refugee Admissions
Program’s commitment to appropriately screening refugee applicants before they
arrive in the country. Refugee admissions having resumed late last month, the
program’s effectiveness is under increased public scrutiny.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Storella,%20Henshaw)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[3]</span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Secondly, the disclosure
will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
interested in the subject, as opposed to FAIR’s individual understanding, as FAIR intends to use its
analytical and editorial skills to publish and disseminate to the general
public the records obtained pursuant to this FOIA request through news
articles, press releases, action alerts, studies, and reports. Notably, FAIR possesses
a special expertise in the subject matter of this FOIA request as the largest
immigration reform organization in the United States that for more than thirty-five
years has published and disseminated information to the public about
immigration-related current events through the various media forms discussed
below.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Lastly,
the disclosure is likely to contribute
“significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities
for the aforementioned reasons.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">In
addition, FAIR
is a nonprofit organization as defined under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code and does not seek this information for any commercial benefit.
FAIR’s committed to protecting the public’s right to be aware of the
immigration-related activities of government agencies and to ensuring the
lawful and appropriate use of government funds by those agencies. As the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has noted, “Congress amended FOIA to
ensure that it is ‘liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial
requesters.’”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Storella,%20Henshaw)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[4]</span></span></a> Of the information requested, there is
no possibility, let alone plans, of pursuing profitmaking opportunities. The information will be used to
further the knowledge and interests of the general public. FAIR intends on disseminating its
analysis of the requested information through its regular channels, discussed
below. FAIR thus
satisfies this element.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal""><span lang=""EN-GB"">Second, FAIR </span>is entitled to a complete waiver of fees<span lang=""EN-GB""> because FAIR
qualifies as a “representative of the news media, or news media requester”
under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). This provision </span><span lang=""EN-GB"">defines “representative[s] of the news media”
broadly to include organizations like FAIR that disseminate news through
electronic communications, including “<i>publishers
of periodicals </i>… who make their products available for purchase by or
subscription by or free distribution to the general public.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Storella,%20Henshaw)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[5]</span></sup></sup></a>
Moreover, the FOIA statute itself, as amended in 2007, explicitly defines
“representative of the news media”–a term previously undefined in the
statute–to specifically include organizations, such as FAIR, that regularly
publish and disseminate online periodicals, <i>e.g.</i>,
newsletters.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Storella,%20Henshaw)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[6]</span></sup></sup></a>
The statutory definition unequivocally requires that organizations which
electronically disseminate information and publications via “alternative media <i>shall</i> be considered to be news-media
entities.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Storella,%20Henshaw)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[7]</span></sup></sup></a>

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit noted FOIA’s legislative
history demonstrates that “it is critical that the phrase ‘representative of
the news media’ be broadly interpreted if the act is to work as expected… In
fact, any person or organization which regularly publishes or disseminates
information to the public… should qualify for waivers as a ‘representative of
the news media.’”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Storella,%20Henshaw)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[9]</span></sup></sup></a><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"">For fee purposes, FAIR requests that search, review, and production
fees for this request be waived for two reasons. First, FAIR is entitled to a
complete waiver of fees because of its public-interest purpose. FOIA’s fee
waiver provision is contained at 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). It states as
follows:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"">Documents shall be furnished
without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under
clause (ii) if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because
it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the
operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the
commercial interest of the requestor.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">The Department of State
(DOS) has promulgated a regulation implementing 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) at
22 C.F.R. § 171.17. This regulation lists four factors that should be used in
determining whether the request is in the public interest:<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2"">1.     
The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the
requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government.”
The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or
activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and
clear, not remote or attenuated. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2"">2.     
The informative value of the information to be disclosed:
Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of
government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested
records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or
activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public
understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information
that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a
substantially identical form, would not be as likely to contribute to such
understanding where nothing new would be added to the public's understanding. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2"">3.     
The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the
public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested
information will contribute to “public understanding.” The disclosure must
contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the
requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and
intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered.
It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this
consideration.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.75in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2"">4.     
The significance of the contribution to public understanding:
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public
understanding of government operations or activities. The public's
understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public
understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be enhanced by the
disclosure to a significant extent. Components shall not make value judgments
about whether information that would contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the government is “important”
enough to be made public.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">The law does not require a FOIA requester who qualifies
for a fee waiver to spell out to the government in exacting detail how the
disclosed information will significantly contribute to the public’s
understanding of the government’s operations. Instead, a requester need merely
“pinpoint the type of government activity he
is investigating” and describe with reasonable specificity the link between the
request and the enhancement of public awareness and understanding of
governmental activities.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Bartlett%20keywords)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title=""""><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>
Also, agencies should administer the fee waiver
provision in “an objective manner and should not rely on their
own, subjective view as to the value of the information.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Bartlett%20keywords)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title=""""><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">FAIR easily satisfies each of the factors in State’s
regulation. Firstly, the information responsive to our request will
significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations and activities
of the government, particularly with regards to the U.S. Refugee Admissions
Program’s commitment to appropriately screening refugee applicants before they
arrive in the country. Refugee admissions having resumed late last month, the
program’s effectiveness is under increased public scrutiny.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Bartlett%20keywords)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[3]</span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Secondly, the disclosure
will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
interested in the subject, as opposed to FAIR’s individual understanding, as FAIR intends to use its
analytical and editorial skills to publish and disseminate to the general
public the records obtained pursuant to this FOIA request through news
articles, press releases, action alerts, studies, and reports. Notably, FAIR possesses
a special expertise in the subject matter of this FOIA request as the largest
immigration reform organization in the United States that for more than thirty-five
years has published and disseminated information to the public about
immigration-related current events through the various media forms discussed
below.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Lastly,
the disclosure is likely to contribute
“significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities
for the aforementioned reasons.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">In
addition, FAIR
is a nonprofit organization as defined under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code and does not seek this information for any commercial benefit.
FAIR’s committed to protecting the public’s right to be aware of the
immigration-related activities of government agencies and to ensuring the
lawful and appropriate use of government funds by those agencies. As the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has noted, “Congress amended FOIA to
ensure that it is ‘liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial
requesters.’”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Bartlett%20keywords)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[4]</span></span></a> Of the information requested, there is
no possibility, let alone plans, of pursuing profitmaking opportunities. The information will be used to
further the knowledge and interests of the general public. FAIR intends on disseminating its
analysis of the requested information through its regular channels, discussed
below. FAIR thus
satisfies this element.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal""><span lang=""EN-GB"">Second, FAIR </span>is entitled to a complete waiver of fees<span lang=""EN-GB""> because FAIR
qualifies as a “representative of the news media, or news media requester”
under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). This provision </span><span lang=""EN-GB"">defines “representative[s] of the news media”
broadly to include organizations like FAIR that disseminate news through
electronic communications, including “<i>publishers
of periodicals </i>… who make their products available for purchase by or
subscription by or free distribution to the general public.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Bartlett%20keywords)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[5]</span></sup></sup></a>
Moreover, the FOIA statute itself, as amended in 2007, explicitly defines
“representative of the news media”–a term previously undefined in the
statute–to specifically include organizations, such as FAIR, that regularly
publish and disseminate online periodicals, <i>e.g.</i>,
newsletters.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Bartlett%20keywords)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[6]</span></sup></sup></a>
The statutory definition unequivocally requires that organizations which
electronically disseminate information and publications via “alternative media <i>shall</i> be considered to be news-media
entities.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Bartlett%20keywords)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[7]</span></sup></sup></a>
What is more, in <i>National Security
Archive v. U.S. Dep’t of Defense</i>,<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Bartlett%20keywords)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[8]</span></sup></sup></a> the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit noted FOIA’s legislative
history demonstrates that “it is critical that the phrase ‘representative of
the news media’ be broadly interpreted if the act is to work as expected… In
fact, any person or organization which regularly publishes or disseminates
information to the public… should qualify for waivers as a ‘representative of
the news media.’”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DOS/FOIAs/DOS%20FOIA%20(Bartlett%20keywords)%20(11.16.17).docx#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[9]</span></sup></sup></a><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:

FAIR qualified for such status following the fee waiver determinations of two

and production fees for this request be waived for two reasons. First, FAIR is
entitled to a complete waiver of fees because of its public-interest purpose.
FOIA’s fee waiver provision is contained at 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). It
states as follows:<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
mso-add-space:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"">Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at
a charge reduced below the fees established under clause (ii) if disclosure of
the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the
government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
mso-add-space:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"">The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
has promulgated regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) at 45
C.F.R. Part 5. These regulations list four factors that should be used in
determining whether the request is in the public interest:<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2"">1.     
The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the
requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government.”
The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or
activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and
clear, not remote or attenuated. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

The informative value of the information to be disclosed:
Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of
government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested
records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or
activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public
understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information
that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially
identical form, would not be as likely to contribute to such understanding
where nothing new would be added to the public’s understanding. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the
public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested
information will contribute to “public understanding.” The disclosure must
contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the
requester. A requester’s expertise in the subject area and ability and
intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered.
It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this
consideration.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

The significance of the contribution to public understanding:
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public
understanding of government operations or activities. The public’s
understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public
understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be enhanced by the
disclosure to a significant extent. Components shall not make value judgments
about whether information that would contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the government is “important”
enough to be made public.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">The law does not require a FOIA requester who qualifies
for a fee waiver to spell out to the government in exacting detail how the
disclosed information will significantly contribute to the public’s
understanding of the government’s operations. Instead, a requester need merely
“pinpoint the type of government activity he
is investigating” and describe with reasonable specificity the link between the
request and the enhancement of public awareness and understanding of
governmental activities.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHHS-HRSA/FOIAs/HHS%20HRSA%20FOIA%2018F049%20(Farmworker%20Justice)%20(11.20.2017).docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title=""""><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>
Also, agencies should administer the fee waiver
provision in “an objective manner and should not rely on their
own, subjective view as to the value of the information.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHHS-HRSA/FOIAs/HHS%20HRSA%20FOIA%2018F049%20(Farmworker%20Justice)%20(11.20.2017).docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title=""""><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a><o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoPlainText"" style=""text-indent:.5in"">FAIR easily satisfies each of the factors
in HHS’s regulation. Firstly, the information responsive to our request will
significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations and
activities of the government, particularly the agency’s funding of an
organization that actively advocates for legislation to create, in its words, “a
roadmap to citizenship for the 11 million aspiring Americans, including
farmworkers and their family members.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHHS-HRSA/FOIAs/HHS%20HRSA%20FOIA%2018F049%20(Farmworker%20Justice)%20(11.20.2017).docx#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[3]</span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Secondly, the disclosure
will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
interested in the subject, as opposed to FAIR’s individual understanding, as FAIR intends to use its
analytical and editorial skills to publish and disseminate to the general
public the records obtained pursuant to this FOIA request through news
articles, press releases, action alerts, studies, and reports. Notably, FAIR possesses
a special expertise in the subject matter of this FOIA request as the largest
immigration reform organization in the United States that for more than thirty-five
years has published and disseminated information to the public about
immigration-related current events through the various media forms discussed
below. <o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Lastly,
the disclosure is likely to contribute
“significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities
for the aforementioned reasons.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">In
addition, FAIR
is a nonprofit organization as defined under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code and does not seek this information for any commercial benefit.
FAIR’s committed to protecting the public’s right to be aware of the
immigration-related activities of government agencies and to ensuring the
lawful and appropriate use of government funds by those agencies. As the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has noted, “Congress amended FOIA to
ensure that it is ‘liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial
requesters.’”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHHS-HRSA/FOIAs/HHS%20HRSA%20FOIA%2018F049%20(Farmworker%20Justice)%20(11.20.2017).docx#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[4]</span></span></a> Of the information requested, there is
no possibility, let alone plans, of pursuing profitmaking opportunities. The information will be used to
further the knowledge and interests of the general public. FAIR intends on disseminating its
analysis of the requested information through its regular channels, discussed
below. FAIR thus
satisfies this element.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal""><span lang=""EN-GB"">Second, FAIR </span>is entitled to a complete waiver of fees<span lang=""EN-GB""> because FAIR
qualifies as a “representative of the news media, or news media requester”
under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). This provision </span><span lang=""EN-GB"">defines “representative[s] of the news media”
broadly to include organizations like FAIR that disseminate news through
electronic communications, including “<i>publishers

Moreover, the FOIA statute itself, as amended in 2007, explicitly defines
“representative of the news media”–a term previously undefined in the
statute–to specifically include organizations, such as FAIR, that regularly
publish and disseminate online periodicals, <i>e.g.</i>,
newsletters.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHHS-HRSA/FOIAs/HHS%20HRSA%20FOIA%2018F049%20(Farmworker%20Justice)%20(11.20.2017).docx#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title=""""><sup><sup><span lang=""EN-GB"">[6]</span></sup></sup></a>

mso-add-space:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"">For fee purposes, FAIR requests that search, review,
and production fees for this request be waived for two reasons. First, FAIR is
entitled to a complete waiver of fees because of its public-interest purpose.
FOIA’s fee waiver provision is contained at 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). It
states as follows:<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
mso-add-space:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"">Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at
a charge reduced below the fees established under clause (ii) if disclosure of
the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the
government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormalCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
mso-add-space:auto;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal"">The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
has promulgated regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) at 45
C.F.R. Part 5. These regulations list four factors that should be used in
determining whether the request is in the public interest:<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2"">1.     
The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the
requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the government.”
The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or
activities of the federal government, with a connection that is direct and
clear, not remote or attenuated. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2"">2.     
The informative value of the information to be disclosed:
Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of
government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested
records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or
activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an increased public
understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information
that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially
identical form, would not be as likely to contribute to such understanding
where nothing new would be added to the public’s understanding. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;

text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2"">3.     
The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the
public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested
information will contribute to “public understanding.” The disclosure must
contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the
requester. A requester’s expertise in the subject area and ability and
intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered.
It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media will satisfy this
consideration.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style=""margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:1.0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;mso-add-space:auto;
text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2"">4.     
The significance of the contribution to public understanding:
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public
understanding of government operations or activities. The public’s
understanding of the subject in question, as compared to the level of public
understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must be enhanced by the
disclosure to a significant extent. Components shall not make value judgments
about whether information that would contribute significantly to public
understanding of the operations or activities of the government is “important”
enough to be made public.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">The law does not require a FOIA requester who qualifies
for a fee waiver to spell out to the government in exacting detail how the
disclosed information will significantly contribute to the public’s
understanding of the government’s operations. Instead, a requester need merely
“pinpoint the type of government activity he
is investigating” and describe with reasonable specificity the link between the
request and the enhancement of public awareness and understanding of
governmental activities.<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHHS-HRSA/FOIAs/HHS%20HRSA%20FOIA%2018F049%20(Farmworker%20Justice)%20(11.20.2017).docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title=""""><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>
Also, agencies should administer the fee waiver
provision in “an objective manner and should not rely on their
own, subjective view as to the value of the information.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHHS-HRSA/FOIAs/HHS%20HRSA%20FOIA%2018F049%20(Farmworker%20Justice)%20(11.20.2017).docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title=""""><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoPlainText"" style=""text-indent:.5in"">FAIR easily satisfies each of the factors
in HHS’s regulation. Firstly, the information responsive to our request will
significantly contribute to public understanding of the operations and
activities of the government, particularly the agency’s funding of an
organization that actively advocates for legislation to create, in its words, “a
roadmap to citizenship for the 11 million aspiring Americans, including
farmworkers and their family members.”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHHS-HRSA/FOIAs/HHS%20HRSA%20FOIA%2018F049%20(Farmworker%20Justice)%20(11.20.2017).docx#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[3]</span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Secondly, the disclosure
will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons
interested in the subject, as opposed to FAIR’s individual understanding, as FAIR intends to use its
analytical and editorial skills to publish and disseminate to the general
public the records obtained pursuant to this FOIA request through news
articles, press releases, action alerts, studies, and reports. Notably, FAIR possesses
a special expertise in the subject matter of this FOIA request as the largest
immigration reform organization in the United States that for more than thirty-five
years has published and disseminated information to the public about
immigration-related current events through the various media forms discussed
below. <o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">Lastly,
the disclosure is likely to contribute
“significantly” to public understanding of government operations or activities
for the aforementioned reasons.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:normal"">In
addition, FAIR
is a nonprofit organization as defined under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code and does not seek this information for any commercial benefit.
FAIR’s committed to protecting the public’s right to be aware of the
immigration-related activities of government agencies and to ensuring the
lawful and appropriate use of government funds by those agencies. As the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has noted, “Congress amended FOIA to
ensure that it is ‘liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial
requesters.’”<a href=""file:///R:/Active%20Matters/Investigations/FOIA%20Administrative%20Documents/DHHS-HRSA/FOIAs/HHS%20HRSA%20FOIA%2018F049%20(Farmworker%20Justice)%20(11.20.2017).docx#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title=""""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference""><span class=""MsoFootnoteReference"">[4]</span></span></a> Of the information requested, there is
no possibility, let alone plans, of pursuing profitmaking opportunities. The information will be used to
further the knowledge and interests of the general public. FAIR intends on disseminating its
analysis of the requested information through its regular channels, discussed
below. FAIR thus
satisfies this element.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:
justify;text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal""><span lang=""EN-GB"">Second, FAIR </span>is entitled to a complete waiver of fees<span lang=""EN-GB""> because FAIR
qualifies as a “representative of the news media, or news media requester”

“representative of the news media”–a term previously undefined in the

publish and disseminate online periodicals, <i>e.g.</i>,

FAIR’s committed to protecting the public’s right to be aware of the
immigration-related activities of government agencies and to ensuring the
lawful and appropriate use of government funds by those agencies. Of the information requested, there is
little possibility, let alone plans, of pursuing profitmaking opportunities. The information will be used to
