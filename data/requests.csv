Documents appear to be quite dated, no current relevance. <br /><br />03-28-2022:  Received production via John Miano, Esq. of three responsive documents, one record was released in full and two records were released in part. Advised Mr. Miano that this case should be settled and closed because it is not relevant to the public today. <br /><br />02-25-2022:  Received production from John Miano, Esq. of two responsive documents that were released in part. The redacted documents involving Jerusalem are dated June, 2016 and have no relevance today. <br /><br />12-23-2021:  Received U.S. Department of State production of heavily redacted one full and 5 partial releases involving visas for Jerusalem dating back to 2006. The information is useless because it is not actionable, extremely dated, of no interest to the public and does not involve any current or future work. Advised John Miano, Esq. that this case should be settled because it wastes our resources. <br /><br />11-30-2021:  Received U.S. Department of State production notice letter via email from John Miano, Esq. stating production is being processed for 5 responsive records, 1 in full and 4 in part.

The information related to visa and the country of Israel. It is not relevant to investigations today.  <br /><br />07-27-2021:  Received production email with attached letter, dated July 27, 2021, via John Miano. Three records have been identified as responsive and have been referred to the ""relevant agency"" with a request to respond directly to FAIR/IRLI with a release determination.   <br /><br />04-19-2021:  Received production via email via John Miano of five additional responses, dating back to 2015 and 2016. Three records were released in part, but heavily redacted to be meaningless and still using the same (b)(5) exemption, and two records were withheld in their entirety.   <br /><br />03-25-2021:  Ralph Casale emailed a US Department of State letter, dated March 19, 2021, and addressed to John Michael Miano. The letter stated that one additional responsive record was identified, but must be withheld in its entirety pursuant to 5 USC, Section 552 (b)(5).

USCIS does not track this information, nor have access to Social Security numbers.  If such records exist, they would be maintained under the jurisdiction of the following agency: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).”  However, we believe the records are within the purview of USCIS. <br /><br />USCIS form I-821D (Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) does capture the Social Security number (SSN) on the form under Part 1 (Information About You), Item 7 (U.S. Social Security Number) (If Any).  It should be noted that we filed a similar request with ICE regarding DACA applicant’s SSNs, and they reported that USCIS has responsive documents.<br /><br />Is it USCIS’ position that although the I-821D has the SSN data field and a DACA applicant enters his/her SSN into that field, USCIS does not track it or use it for any purpose, such as to validate it through the Social Security Administration or E-Verify?","","Jill A.

Called the Public Records Division to obtain an update. An individual spoke to me and took my phone number down, said he would have Stair call me back. He also added that Williams' office has not complied to their order to hand over documents. <br /><br />(12/28/2021) Emailed Williams to ask why this request has not been answered. Williams' said he would figure this out and respond ""as soon as possible."" <br /><br />(12/28/2021) Called Stair's office. He is no longer with the division. However, an employee said he'd transfer our case to one of their compliance attorneys. That attorney will be reaching out in the beginning of the new year. <br /><br />(1/11/2022) Emailed Williams again, following no response. <br /><br />(1/11/2022) Williams responded with the following message: ""I have collected some records and I provided them to the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Advancement for their review. I have alerted a representative from the that office in an effort to obtain an update on the status of your August 30, 2021 public records request. I will provide an update to you once additional information is provided to me by the department.""<br /><br />(2/3/2022) Called and spoke to another individual at the office. He said Marcus (the individual apparently assigned to our case) just left the office, but that he would leave a message for Marcus to call me back tomorrow. <br /><br />(2/9/2022) Spoke to Marcus again. He took my cell for an attorney. Office email address: pre@sec.state.ma.us attorney is Angela Puccini. Email Angela if I haven't heard back. <br /><br />(2/9/2022) Angela called me back. She said she has reached out to Boston to see where they stand. She is going to see how they respond this week before deciding on how to move forward... Williams emailed me to say he heard from Puccini and is working on the request. <br /><br />(3/17/2022) Did not receive production or any status update from Williams. Reached out to Angela for any new updates. <br /><br />(5/2/2022) Emailed Shawn -- with Angela cc'd -- asking for a status update. The email included the timeline on non-compliance from his office. <br /><br />(5/12/2022) Angela called me to touch base. She asked me to send Shawn a final email (with her cc'd) to inquire about this status. She will use the email to begin the process of litigation. <br /><br />(5/31/2022) After back and forth on email, we agreed to narrow our time limitations from 2019 2021.
