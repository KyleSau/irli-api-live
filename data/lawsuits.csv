"Agusto Niz-Chavez v. Matthew Whitaker, 19-863 (U.S.), 0:18-ag-04264 (6th cir.)","Notice : The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider whether a deportation notice that contains missing information can be fixed with a follow-up notice.<br />UPDATE: U.S. Sup. Ct ruling 4/29/21: In a 6-3 decision by Gorsuch, joined by Thomas, Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan, and Barrett, the Court held that a notice to appear issued to non-resident aliens to inform them of a removal action terminates an alien’s continuous presence in the country only if the notice is one document that contains all statutorily required information; the notice may not be broken up into multiple documents sent over a period of time. Nonpermanent resident aliens who have been subject to removal from the country may be eligible for discretionary relief if they can show ten years of continuous residence in the country. The “stop-time rule” of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, however, provides that the alien’s period of continuous residence terminates when the alien receives “a notice” to appear for removal proceedings. Here, Niz-Chavez received two documents over two months that, together, included all the information statutorily required to be present in the notice. He argued, therefore, that his period of continuous residence did not end because he did not receive “a” notice, but two. The government countered that notice was completed upon receipt of the second document. The Court sided with Niz-Chavez holding that the indefinite article “a” “suggests Congress used ‘notice’ in its countable sense.”<br />","CHH, Gina D'Andrea","12/28/18 complaint filed; Pet. appealed 6th Circ. ruling to U.S.; 6/8/20 U.S. accepted Pets.

Although this Court has not yet addressed how these<br />precedents apply to unlawfully present aliens, the lower courts are deeply divided as to how they do.<br />Respondent, an unauthorized alien, asserted a Padilla/Lee claim. It is undisputed that he had no substantive right to remain in the U.S., and was thus subject to deportation at any time.

The AZ Supreme Court nevertheless extended Padilla and Lee to unauthorized aliens and held that Respondent had established prejudice under Strickland.<br />Questions Presented:<br />1. Whether Respondent is categorically barred from establishing Strickland prejudice for a Padilla/Lee claim because, as an unauthorized alien, he is without any legal right to remain in the United States.<br />2.

Plaintiffs challenge the lawfulness of in absentia removal orders entered pursuant to allegedly deficient Notices to Appear before immigration judges. Plaintiffs claim that those NTAs sometimes reflected the incorrect dates of upcoming appearances; were sent to incorrect addresses; did not include the dates, times, or locations of upcoming appearances; or were sent to children who cannot read English and/or have no control over whether they appear. Plaintiffs contend that the process by which unrepresented immigrants may challenge the removal orders — that is, by filing a written motion to reopen — is effectively unavailable to those who speak limited, if any, English and lack the capacity to read, understand, and comply with the requirements for writing and filing a motion to reopen. Plaintiffs argue, the motion-to-reopen process does not provide unrepresented individuals facing imminent removal any meaningful opportunity to challenge defects in their in absentia removal orders prior to deportation","","Complaint filed 7/11/19; DistCt granted Defs' MTD 9/5/19; Pltfs appealed to 2nd Cir. 11/4/19;<br />2nd Cir.: awaiting Briefing Schedule<br /><br />IRLI to monitor for entry of Briefing Schedule","","","","No","Prospective","1","08/18/2020 1:49pm"

Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (2015) - Waples Mobile Home Park Limited Partnership (“Waples”) is the owner of a mobile-home park in Fairfax County, VA, with a policy that all adult occupants of its mobile-home park—regardless of age, gender, or national origin—provide proof of U.S. citizenship or legal residency. Plaintiffs, four married couples, brought a lawsuit challenging the policy as discriminatory under the FHA. The four male plaintiffs provided the required proof, but their female spouses could not. Plaintiffs claim “disparate-impact” discrimination because the majority of those adversely impacted by the policy are Latinos. The district court applied Inclusive Communities and dismissed Plaintiff’s disparate impact claim, but a divided 4th Cir. panel vacated that ruling. The majority concluded that Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged “robust causality” because the policy disproportionately affects Latino tenants “compared to non-Latino tenants” at the park","","On or about May 22, 2020 Ps must file reply brief that addresses D's brief.<br />On or about May 15, 2020 Ds must file brief that addresses the 2 Qs (below)<br />On or about 4/30/2020 Plaintiffs must file initial brief answering 2 Qs: 1.

"In re Mary and Jane Doe, 20180806 (S.Ct UT)","ACLU, Others Support Dreamers Seeking Utah Bar Admission - the American Civil Liberties Union of Utah and others have filed briefs backing arguments by two ""Dreamers"" who have asked the state's Supreme Court to allow undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to be licensed to practice law. The organization's brief argues that DACA recipients should receive the same treatment as other bar applicants and that their undocumented status has no bearing on their character or fitness to practice law, given that they were brought to this country as children and it is not illegal for them to remain in the country. The Utah State Legislature did not take a position on what action the high court should take, but said that it agrees with the petitioners that the decision belongs to the court and not the legislature. A 1996 law prohibits states from issuing professional licenses to undocumented immigrants unless the state legislature passes a measure opting out of the law. However, under the Utah Constitution, the state Supreme Court has sole jurisdiction over regulating lawyers. In its amicus brief, the legislature said that in its analysis, the 1996 law either only applies to professional licenses regulated by the legislature, or the law is unconstitutional. Therefore, it said, the court should be able to decide the question. The state legislature and state attorney general both weighed in regarding the question of whether the court should decide the issue, but did not offer input on what the court's decision should be. The American Bar Association passed a resolution in 2017 that undocumented applicants should not be rejected out of hand for bar admission. If Utah does allow undocumented immigrants to be admitted to the bar, it will join half a dozen other states that have taken this step, including California, New York and Florida","","A total of nine amicus briefs have been filed in the case, with only one (from the federal gov't) opposing the petitioners; Appellant's Reply Brief filed 4/25/19; Oral Argument held 10/7/19, awaiting Ct decision<br /><br />3/29/19 - discussed with Chris Re IRLI involvement - amicus submission deadlines have passed but we should track for any further appeal to U.S. S.Ct<br />Ct Dkt can be accessed here: https://www.utcourts.gov/cgi-bin/appell/appelsearch.cgi","","","","No","Prospective","2","10/10/2019 11:08am"

USCIS’s decision, implemented through changes to a USCIS form, its instructions, and USCIS manuals, narrows the grounds on which individuals can qualify for fee waivers. The decision also makes it harder for individuals to apply for fee waivers by requiring that they obtain and submit certain specified forms of documentation from the IRS or other sources. USCIS violated the procedural requirements of the APA by adopting the new fee-waiver form and its instructions, which limit applicants’ ability to receive fee waivers, without undertaking notice-and-comment rulemaking. USCIS also failed to comply with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), the statute under which it purported to adopt the new form and instructions. Further, the revisions to the form, instructions, and USCIS manuals are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. USCIS failed to make clear its rationale for the changes, offered shifting<br />and illogical justifications, and relied on assertions that lack supporting data, contradict each other, or contradict the data before the agency","","Judge Richard A.

Illegal immigrants who enroll in DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, are only required to pay 150% of the in-state tuition rate. But Arizona enacted Prop. 300 in 2006, which prohibits education subsidies to illegal immigrants. In addition, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled last year that state universities and community colleges can’t offer in-state tuition to DACA recipients. But the regents have ignored that ruling. ASU even has a special page dedicated to DACA and other illegal immigrants.

The question before the Court is whether the Texas statute is preempted by federal law mandating that, if a university provides an educational benefit based on residence to an alien who lacks lawful immigration status, then that university must provide the<br />same benefit to a United States citizen regardless of the citizen’s residency.
